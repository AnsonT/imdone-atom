Manage your TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, etc in a drag and drop task board.

Great issue tracking for tiny teams and MVP's.

Tiny teams who are getting shit done and need every moment, don't have time for issue trackers.  iMDone gives you an interface similar to Trello for your TODO comments.

Most tools give you a list of TODO comments with no real order.  iMDone lets you give them a sort order and keeps them in sync with your project files.

iMDone allows todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the syntax guide at [imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats)
