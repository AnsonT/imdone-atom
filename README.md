# imdone-atom
A task-board for TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, etc in your code.

iMDone gives you an interface similar to Trello for your TODO comments.  Most tools give you a list of TODO comments with no regard to order.  iMDone lets you sort them in the order you want and keeps them in sync with your project files.

iMDone works best with todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the [syntax guide at imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats)

Ignoring files
----
1. Configuration setting  
You can ignore files with the "Exclude Vcs Ignored Paths" setting

2. .imdoneignore  
[Glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) patterns in `.imdoneignore` will be matched against files and directories.  For example, if your project is in `/home/jesse/projects/imdone-atom` and your `.imdoneignore` looks like this, then all files and folders in `/home/jesse/projects/imdone-atom/lib` will be ignored.
```
lib
```
3. .imdone/config.json  
iMDone will also ignore files and folders that match a regex in the `.imdone/config.json`, `exclude` array.  The array is seeded with some common excludes on first run.

**IMPORTANT:** If your project is large (#files > 1000) consider adding an .imdoneignore file.

Linking to External Resources with Metadata
----
Using [todo.txt metadata](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#metadata) in your tasks and a few modifications to `.imdone/config.json`, you can link to external resources like github issues and profiles.  Look at [imdone/imdone-core#metadata](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#metadata) for more info.

Check out [this example](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-atom/blob/master/.imdone/config.json#L48).
