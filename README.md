# imdone-atom

Issue tracking for Tiny Teams and MVP's and a better way to manage TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, etc in your project.

Tiny teams who are getting shit done and need every moment, don't have time for issue trackers.  iMDone gives you an interface similar to Trello for your TODO comments.

Most tools give you a list of TODO comments with no real order.  iMDone lets you give them a sort order and auto updates
on changes.  You can also hide/show and reorder lists.

imdone-atom allows todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the syntax guide at [imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats)
