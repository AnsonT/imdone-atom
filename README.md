# imdone-atom

A task-board for TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, etc in your code.

Great issue tracking for tiny teams and MVP's.

Tiny teams who are getting shit done and need every moment, don't have time for issue trackers.  iMDone gives you an interface similar to Trello for your TODO comments.

Most tools give you a list of TODO comments with no real order.  iMDone lets you sort them in the order you want and keeps them in sync with your project files.

iMDone works best with todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the [syntax guide at imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats)
